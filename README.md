    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by writing tests to check that it works as expected and makes sure that even edge cases are handled. I also make sure that all requirments are met like if IDs or phone numbers are too long or if there are duplacite IDs they will be caught and there will be an error message displayed. I know that if one thing goes wrong it can snowball into a bigger issue so I try my best to prevent that.  
    
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    I interpret user needs by looking at the requirments they have shared when discussing the design of the program and how it should. I then break those requirments down into smaller pieces and figure out what the code needs to doand then emplament them. 
    
    How do I approach designing software?
    I approach designing software first by going over the requirments, breaking them downinto managable pieces, and then writing code to meet those requirments. I then make sure that those requirments are being met and there are no issues by testing them with Junit tests.
